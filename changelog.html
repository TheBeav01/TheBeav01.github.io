    <h3>0.02.0</h3>
    <h4>Major changes</h4>
    <p>An extremely basic prestige system has been unlocked after 20K or so gold. Use the chronometer to
        go back in time. Note: Upgrades are a little too far apart. Should be resolved in the next patch as I improve the
        feel of the first run.
    </p>
    <p>A new resource system has been added to the save file! As you play, new resources are added
        when they are discovered. As a consequence, this has made the worker and gold parts of the save
        obsolete. The relevant fields have been removed in this patch. Clear your cookies and reload to start fresh.
        A compatability patch may be added to address this in the future.
    </p>
    <p>There is now a very rudimentary story covering early game. These are in the form of popup boxes
        that can be clicked to remove. The save fields have been adjusted to fit this system.
    </p>
    <p>There are now upgrades. Upgrades cost resources. Eventually, a tooltip is going to be implemented that explains the cost.</p>
    <h4>Minor changes</h4>
    <p>Fixed a longstanding issue where the save would be cleared when you close the browser. Whoops.</p>
    <p>Fixed dropdown issues on Chrome.</p>
    <h3>0.01.05</h3>
    <h4>Major changes</h4>
    <p>Tabs should be a lot easier to work with, so that means I can add more on the right panel easily. They should
        autosize on start. This is in preparation for more potential systems.
    </p>
    <h5>Cosmetic changes</h5>
    <p>Adjusted some text on the site. Gold management is now resource management. Town info is now world info.
        Manage workers is now upgrades.
    </p>
    <p>Brought back the border between top bar and main screen.</p>
    <p>Removed the button borders. These should give a flatter look to things.</p>
    <p>On that vein of things, I added some button effects on mouseover. The diabled color should be different
        to make life easier as well. All buttons have this.
    </p>
    <p>New dropdown color.</p>
