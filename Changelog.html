    <h3>0.01.05</h3>
    <h4>Major changes</h4>
    <p>Tabs should be a lot easier to work with, so that means I can add more on the right panel easily. They should
        autosize on start. This is in preparation for more potential systems.
    </p>
    <h5>Cosmetic changes</h5>
    <p>Adjusted some text on the site. Gold management is now resource management. Town info is now world info.
        Manage workers is now upgrades.
    </p>
    <p>Brought back the border between top bar and main screen.</p>
    <p>Removed the button borders. These should give a flatter look to things.</p>
    <p>On that vein of things, I added some button effects on mouseover. The diabled color should be different
        to make life easier as well. All buttons have this.
    </p>
    <p>New dropdown color.</p>
